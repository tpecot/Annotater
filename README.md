# Annotater
ImageJ plugin for annotating multi-spectral 2D images.

<br />
The Annotater was designed to efficiently manually annotate or correct 2D image segmentations (objects and/or areas) and to identify markers associated with objects, either by manually annotating them, by using a thresholding tool or by using a logistic regression.<br />
